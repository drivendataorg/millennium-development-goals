# United Nations Millennium Development Goals

## Goal of the Competition
In the year 2000, the member states of the United Nations agreed to a set of goals to measure the progress of global development. The aim of these goals was to increase standards of living around the world by **emphasizing human capital, infrastructure, and human rights.**

**The eight goals are:**

    1) To eradicate extreme poverty and hunger
    2) To achieve universal primary education
    3) To promote gender equality and empower women
    4) To reduce child mortality
    5) To improve maternal health
    6) To combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases
    7) To ensure environmental sustainability
    8) To develop a global partnership for development

The UN measures progress towards these goals using indicators such as percent of the population making over one dollar per day. **Your task is to predict the change in these indicators one year and five years into the future.** Predicting future progress will help us to understand how we achieve these goals by uncovering complex relations between these goals and other economic indicators. The UN set 2015 as the target for measurable progress. Given the data from 1972 - 2007, you need to predict a specific indicator for each of these goals in 2008 and 2012.
